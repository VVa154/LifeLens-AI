you can't change
nobody cares
just get over it
stop complaining
you are a failure
deal with it
you're hopeless
nothing will ever get better
you're not good enough
you should give up
it's all your fault
nobody likes you
you're wasting your time
don't bother trying
you will fail
you are weak
you are worthless
no one needs you
you're always wrong
you don't matter
crying won't help
you're too sensitive
grow up
suck it up
stop being a baby
nobody respects you
you are alone
you don't deserve happiness
people hate you
you should be ashamed
it's pointless
why even try
you are a burden
no one will ever love you
it's better if you weren't here
